# Real world example of supply chain network where there is rarely any reciprocity: Construction of Airplanes. 
# Main vertices is the firm constructing the airplane (B), where all manufactured parts end up (high in-degree, low out-degree). 
# On the other hand, among manufactures of airplane parts little reciprocity might occur as they need specialized part to 
# finish their own parts (D and A).

# Exercise B.2
# Degree of agents
id <- cbind(1,3,2,3,0,1)

degree_table <- rbind(id, od)

# B and D have the most links directed towards them while E has none directed towards it. Hence, B and D are the most central "buyers", E the least.
# A and D have the most links directed towards others while B has none directed towards others. Hence A and D are the most central "suppliers" and B the least.

# Eigen-centrality: the measure depicts an agentâ€™s centrality within a network
# proportional to the sum of her links to other agents, weighted by their own centrality.

# D is the most central vertices, while E and F are the least central ones.

##### Exercise B.2.1: How would centrality change if you considered a row-normalized network instead?
# Compute row sums for normalization
#adj_matrix <- as.data.frame(as.matrix(adj_matrix)) # if not working use: as.matrix()
row_sums <- rowSums(adj_matrix, dims = 1)

  # Check if the column exists

round(degree_table_norm, 2)

# As expected based on the slides, the out-degree of the agents are equalized to 1.
# Also, the most central buyers are still B and D.



##### Exercise B.2.2: How would the network change if you removed or added a specific agent?

# Define the edges

# Convert the row names and column names to node labels

colnames(adj_matrix1) <- V(g1)$name

# Print the adjacency matrix
print(adj_matrix1)

### Exercise B.3
# For our real world example we choose level of experience as the agent characteristic and
# number of defects as the response variable. The coefficient beta we choose to be -0.8 indicating
# that more experience leads to less defects. We assign some values to the other parameters gamma, lamda
# and sigma^2 as indicated in the code.

# Assigning values for simulation:
# For replicability
set.seed(1234)

# Parameters
lambda <- 0.4  # Parameter for the network effect
beta <- -1     # Coefficient for the direct effect of X
theta <- 0.5   # Coefficient for the network-lagged effect of X
gamma <- 0.8

reps <- 1000
estimate <- vector("numeric", reps)

for (i in 1:reps) {
  x <- rnorm(6)
  W <- adj_matrix
  errs <- rnorm(N, 0, 1)
  Wx <- W %*% x %*% theta
  S = diag(N) - lambda * W
  y = solve(S, Wx * gamma + x * beta + errs)
  x <- as.matrix(x)
  y <- as.matrix(y)
  model_1 <- lm(y ~ x)
  estimate[i] <- coef(model_1)["x"]
}

estimate_mean <- mean(estimate)
print(estimate_mean)

# The liner-in-means model estimate depicts a larger negative relationship between level of experience
# and number of defects than we initially set (-0.8). Hence, there is a bias present.

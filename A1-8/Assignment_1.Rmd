## Set Up File

Super cool trick for the R_Markdown is to have saved the workspace of your basic R_file somewhere in the project and then load it directly. In this way you have all the necessary objects and plots from that basic R_file, within your R_Markdown_file, too. There is no need to repeat and rerun the code to plot something. You can just "call" it :)

```{r}
load("./WS_CD.RData")
```

```{r}
TR_plot_2
```
bla bla the actual text will follow ...
